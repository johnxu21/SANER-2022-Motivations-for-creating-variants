\begin{abstract}
%Some developers are reusing existing software software (OSS) hosted on social coding platforms by splitting-off a new development branch, often to steer the development into another direction, without the intention to  contribute back. We call these kind of forks variants of the original (mainline) projects.
%We conduct an exploratory study on variant forks to understand the motivations behind variant fork creation and maintenance. Our study is based on a survey conducted on 112 maintainers of 105 active OSS variants projects hosted on GitHub a very popular social coding platform. Our study confirms and extends the findings of previous studies. Among the findings, we identify a number of fine-grained motivations behind the creation and maintenance of variants. We also identify concrete reasons why there is limited interaction between the mainline and variant projects. Based on our findings, we discuss future research direction in the line of efficient software reuse between the variants and the mainline counterparts.

Social coding platforms centred around git %(e.g., \gh, GitLab, Bitbucket)
provide explicit facilities to share code between projects: forks, pull requests, cherry-picking to name but a few.
Variant forks are an interesting phenomenon in that respect, as it permits for different projects to peacefully co-exist, yet explicitly acknowledge the common ancestry.
Several researchers analysed forking practices on open source platforms and observed that variant forks get created frequently.
However, today little is known on the motivations for launching such a variant fork.
Is it mainly technical (e.g., diverging features), governance (e.g., diverging interests), legal (e.g., diverging licences), or do other factors come into play?
In this paper we report the results of an exploratory qualitative analysis on the motivations behind variant fork creation and maintenance.
We surveyed 112 maintainers of 105 active open source variant projects hosted on \gh. %, a very popular social coding platform.
Our study extends previous findings, identifying a number of fine-grained common motivations for launching a variant fork and listing concrete impediments for maintaining the co-existing projects.

%TOM: FORCE NEW PAGE FOR REFERENCES (since we have 10+1page)

%\tm{John, clean up references, for example, make sure that all titles of papers properly use capitalisation. There are many places where this is not the case because by default latex puts all words in titles of a citation in lowercase. So you have to force words that you need to uppercase by putting them between curly braces.}
%\tm{There are other things that can be reduced, e.g. no need to put "Proceedings of", no need to put the conference number (e.g. 19th) or conference year as part of the conference title. Otherwise the year will be shown twice. Be consistent in using DOI or URL for citations. Either use it everywhere or nowhere. Preferably consistently use the DOI instead of some publisher-specific URL if the DOI is available.}
