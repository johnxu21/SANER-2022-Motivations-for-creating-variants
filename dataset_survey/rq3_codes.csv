interaction;code
I do not discuss, but I am not sure if other maintainers do;not sure
No, there has never been any discussion since the creation of the variant;never
They used to discuss but not anymore since the projects have technically diverged from each other;technically diverged
We will discuss things if we have common issues that need to be solved (eg a security issue that both projects have to fix), but otherwise discussion is unneeded.;common issues are discussed
Project follow original one in terms of functionality, but does not aim to expand it. It just make it work on Windows platform.;variant follows mainline
No longer relevant, as the fork is now only used as a means to create PR's;never
No, the variant has merged back into mainline. There was never any discussion while the variant existed, it was just interim to satisfy Thread's (my company's) immediate needs and we always intended to return to mainline.;variant merged back
Yes, they still discuss the direction of the projects;yes
They are effectively the same repository;conntrolled by same developers
There as been a single interaction, which was to mostly giving the idea that the project wasn't maintained anymore https://github.com/tadas-s/isbnjs/issues/17;only once
Mainline project is not very active, so it's hard to discuss;mainnline not very active
The mainline is actively hostile to the variant;mainline hostile
mainline disappeared;never
Since the variant has merged back into mainline I don't think this is relevant. I still participate in discussions on mainline and am working to get some of my external code incorported into mainline. Specifically re: https://github.com/tgbugs/pyontutils/issues/92;variant merged back
We still use the mainline, just port our custom modifications to newer releases.;variant follows mainline
Very rarely common issues arise and are discussed.;common issues are discussed
In the crypto world, the mainline inherits changes from BITCOIN, for example, security commits, and the variant merges those changes in. So the variant is very interested in every change in the Mainline. However, the variant must maintain the specific new features that we added separately, and the Mainline is not interested in helping the Variant do this.;variant follows mainline
Mainline defines main directions of the project, variant follows mainline updates;variant follows mainline
We’re in contact but rarely discuss;in contact but rarely discuss
Technical solutions get swapped in both directions as osmosis. Creative decisions (since we're both games) are kept very separate, though.;swap techical details
Not really. I’m no longer contributing to the main project but I still keep in touch with the current contributors and support them however I can;never
The variant is only a mirror of the mainline;variant is a mirror of mainline
The variant was only created to meed additional technical needs. Other than that, it was kept more-or-less up to date with mainline.;variant follows mainline
The project was almost finished at the time, so I don't consider there are new features added other than the new translations.;never
Both of them are controlled by myself, just wanted to change the project path actually, but in the future I would keep to update it on the variant.;conntrolled by same developers
