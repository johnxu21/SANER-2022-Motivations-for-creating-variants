\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:rqs}

Our examination of the literature revealed that while several
studies have investigated variant forks, only a limited number has been performed on \gh.
The main goal of this paper is therefore to identify and understand the developers' motivation behind creating and maintaining variant forks in the \gh social coding platforms, and how these variant forks co-evolve and collaborate with the mainline projects.

Consequently, we define the following research questions:

\ad{@John: These RQs seem to be the questions you asked in the survey, and not really research questions. I believe we should formulate concrete RQs here, and link the questions of the survey to these RQs (in that case, I would introduce the survey questions in the next section, or even in the ``results'' section). I think it should be easy to sell question 2 as a RQ. For question 3, it's mostly a matter of formulation (How do they interact/co-evolve/collaborate) and we can include question 1 in it. TL;DR: A first RQ about the ``why'' (includes questions 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3); A second one about the ``how'' (includes questions 1, 1.1, 1.2 as a preliminary step towards questions 3, 3.1, 3.2)}

%\nd  \textbf{\rqOne} With this RQ, we aim to investigate if the motivations reported in literature still hold or are there new ones in this \gh era?.
%With this research question, we aim to investigate if the creators of the variant were part core developers of upstream or not, and whether the upstream and variant currently have active maintainers.

\nd \textbf{\rqTwo} With this RQ, we aim to identify the impediments that could possibly explain the limited code integration between the variants and mainlines during their co-evolution.

% \nd \textbf{\rqThree} In Section~\ref{sec:background}, the literature based on quantitative analysis of variants from three ecosystems revealed that there is limited interaction between variants and upstream repositories. With this research question, we want to ascertain if this holds by performing a qualitative study. We asked the following subquestions.
