\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The collaborative nature of open source software (OSS) development has led to the advent of social coding platforms centred around the git version control system, such as \gh, BitBucket, and GitLab.
These platforms bring the collaborative nature and code reuse of OSS development to another level, via facilities like forking, pull requests and cherry-picking.
Developers may fork a \textit{mainline repository} into a new \textit{forked repository} and take governance over the latter while preserving the full revision history of the former.
Before the advent of social coding platforms, forking was rare and was typically intended to compete with the original project~\cite{Linus:2012Perspectives,Gregorio:2012,Viseur:2012Forks,Linus:2013CodeForking,Linus:2011ToFork,Gamalielsson:2014Sustainability}.

With the rise of pull-based development~\cite{Gousios:2014ICSE}, forking has become more common and the community typically characterises forks by their purpose~\cite{Zhou:2020}.
\textit{Social forks} are created for isolated development with the goal of contributing back to the mainline.
In contract, \textit{variant forks} are created by splitting off a new development branch
to steer development into a new direction, while leveraging the code of the mainline project~\cite{sung:ICSE:2020}.
% without necessarily intending to contribute back to the mainline.\cd{Are these definitions correct? Does a variant fork become a social fork if it is contributed back? If the real distinguishing factor is the next sentence, it should be incorporated in the definition.}

Several studies have investigated the motivations behind variant forks in the context of OSS projects~\cite{Linus:2012Perspectives,Gregorio:2012,Viseur:2012Forks,Linus:2013CodeForking,Linus:2011ToFork,Gamalielsson:2014Sustainability}.
However, most have been conducted before the rise of social coding platforms and it is known that \gh has significantly changed the perception and practices of forking~\cite{Zhou:2020}.
%Developers tend to perceive social forks as alternatives to the original mainline project~\cite{Zhou:2020}
%\cd{Is this supported by the literature? \jb{yes, ~\cite{Zhou:2020}}}, and variant forks
In this social coding era, variant projects often evolve out of social forks rather than being planned deliberately~\cite{Zhou:2020}.
To this end, social coding platforms often enable mainlines and variants to peacefully co-exist rather than compete.
%\cd{From what I've read so far, I cannot conclude that variant forks are not competing for the attention of the same developers/end users. Perhaps you need to stress the reason why more. It will be important for the motivation of this work.}, 
Little is known on the motivations for creating variants in the social coding era, making it worthwhile
%\cd{understatement} 
to revisit the motivation for creating variant forks (\textit{why?}).

Social coding platforms offer many facilities for code sharing (e.g., pull requests and cherry-picking).
So if projects co-exist, one would expect variant forks to take advantage of this common ancestry, and frequently exchange interesting updates (e.g., patches) on the common artefacts.
Despite advanced code-sharing facilities, Businge et al. observed very limited code integration, using the \git and \gh facilities, between the mainline and its variant projects~\cite{businge:emse:2021}.
This suggests that code sharing facilities in themselves are not enough for graceful co-evolution, making it worthwhile to investigate impediments for co-evolution (\textit{how?}).

\noindent
We therefore explore two research questions:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item
\textit{\textbf{\RQOne}}
The literature pre-dating \git and social coding platforms identified four categories of motivations for creating variant forks: technical (e.g., diverging features), governance (e.g., diverging interests), legal (e.g., diverging licences), and personal (e.g., diverging principles).
$RQ1$ aims to investigate whether those motivations for variant forks are still the same, or whether new factors have come into play. 

%\item
\textit{\textbf{\RQTwo}}
If, despite advanced code sharing facilities, there is limited code integration between the mainline and the variant projects, a possible cause could be related to how the teams working on the variants and the mainline are structured.
Therefore, $RQ2$ investigates the overlap between the teams maintaining the mainline and variant forks, and how these teams interact.
As such we hope to identify impediments for co-evolution.
%\end{itemize}


The investigations are based on an online survey conducted with 105 maintainers involved in different active variant forks hosted on \gh.

Our contributions are manifold:
we identify new reasons for creating and maintaining variant forks;
we identify and categorize different code reuse and change propagation practices between a variant and its mainline;
we confirm that little code integration occurs between a variant and its mainline, and uncover concrete reasons for this phenomenon.
We discuss the implications of these findings and how tools can help to achieve an efficient code integration and collaboration between mainlines and diverging variant forks.
