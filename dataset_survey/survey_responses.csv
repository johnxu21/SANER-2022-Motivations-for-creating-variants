The reason it was created is because 5 years ago the permissions model for GitHub and Travis is not what it is today. I was using my X github account for work, and I had access to a few private repos containing customer code. I wanted to use Travis for CI/CD but if I granted Travis access to my primary github account, it would have read access to all the github repos that the X github account had access to, which would expose private customer code to Travis unnecessarily. So, I simply created a second github account and forked the repo so that I could grant Travis access without compromising the privacy of the customer code on my main account.

The mainline and variant have different playerbases (and thus communities) with different gameplay tastes. It was decided very early on that following in lock-step with mainline would make integrating custom gameplay features difficult. It's also a very large burder on the variant's development community to try and stay up to date the mainline, specially if the mainline has a more active development cycle (which it very much did in the beginning). So a hard decoupling made it easier for us to live our own life.
